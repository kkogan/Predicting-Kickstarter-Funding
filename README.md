## My Design draft

#### Question/need: 
As a tabletop game developer, what can I do to raise the maximum amount of money for my next tabletop game project with a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter?

#### Description of my sample data:
I scraped data about projects in the Tabletop Games category from Kickstarter search results, as well as corresponding project, rewards, and creator pages.

I also pulled descriptive data about the games from BoardGameGeek's API, but ended up running out of time before incorporating into my analysis.
